# AI-Powered Security Threat Intelligence Platform

## Overview
This branch of the repository focuses on building the AI models for the Security Threat Intelligence Platform. The goal is to leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance the detection and analysis of security threats.

## Features
- **Threat Detection**: Utilize AI models to identify potential security threats in real-time.
- **Threat Analysis**: Analyze detected threats to understand their nature and potential impact.
- **Automated Response**: Implement automated responses to mitigate identified threats.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/kelvinwambua/security-threat-intelligence-platform.git
    cd security-threat-intelligence-platform
    git checkout ai-branch
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    # source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Train the AI model:
    ```sh
    python train_model.py
    ```

2. Run the threat detection:
    ```sh
    python detect_threats.py
    ```
